Welcome to the repository for your Chandrayaan 3 Lunar Craft Control assessment. In this repository, you will find the code and documentation related to your assessment submission.

This repository contains the implementation of the Chandrayaan 3 Lunar Craft Control program. The program translates commands sent from Earth into instructions understood by the spacecraft, allowing it to navigate through the galaxy.

Problem Statement : 
You are a scientist at ISRO responsible for controlling the Chandrayaan 3 lunar spacecraft. Your mission is to develop a program that translates commands from Earth into instructions understood by the spacecraft. The spacecraft navigates through the galaxy using galactic coordinates represented by x, y, and z coordinates (x for east or west location, y for north or south location, and z for distance above or below the galactic plane).
